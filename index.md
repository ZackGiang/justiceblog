# Mapping Evictions, Ellis Act, and Affordable Housing 

## Evictions and the Ellis Act

Since the passing of the Ellis Act by the California State Legislature in 1985, thousands of residents across the state have been evicted and displaced from their homes. The act allows landlords to evict all of their tenants in order to “go out of the rental business” and clear their properties from the rental market. However in cities like San Francisco, this new right has led to the mass displacement of renters and continues to exacerbate the housing crisis within the city. Low income tenants, who often relied on rent controlled units to survive, are being forced onto the streets and driven out of their communities at alarming rates. 

Most commonly, corporate landlords in the city have implemented the Ellis Act to increase profits by evicting residents, demolishing affordable housing, and converting units into condos or group-owned tenancy-in-common flats that are exempt from rent control policy. Though the terms of the act require landlords to provide modest relocation payments to evicted tenants, many have found ways around the payments by threatening tenants or harassing them until they leave. Indeed, this practice has proven to be an incredibly lucrative way for landlords to grow profit margins and avoid the rent control supporting low-income tenants. Though very rewarding for land owners, it is clear that Ellis Act evictions have been disastrous for renters with the diminished availability of affordable housing driving the skyrocketing rental prices in the city.

## Anti-Eviction Mapping Project

However, this trend has not gone unnoticed. In 2013, an organization called the Anti-Eviction Mapping Project (AEMP) released a mapping tool dedicated to visualizing and uncovering the dramatic impact of the Ellis Act on evictions in San Francisco. The map represents Ellis Act evictions as red circles of varying sizes that mark the location of the evictions on a map of San Francisco as time progresses. The circles are scaled proportionally to the amount of people evicted in order to communicate the severity and size of each eviction event. All in all, it is an extremely effective visualization that manages to capture the scope of the evictions, the locations of their occurrences, and the relationship between place and time.

Additionally, the map takes a clear stance on social justice and Ellis Act evictions. This is best seen in the large red circles representing the evictions that seem to “explode” on the map in a visual language that communicates the damage caused by the evictions as if they are bombs peppering San Francisco’s landscape. Undeniably, the evictions are painted in a bad light that brings attention to the sweeping scale and widespread implementation of the Ellis Act to evict renters. It is evident that the creators of the map are trying to intervene into this ongoing issue that threatens to exacerbate the housing crisis and disproportionately harm low-income renters. With this map, AEMP advocates for the displaced renting population of San Francisco and attempts to combat the Ellis Act evictions by shedding light on its effect on San Francisco residents. 

Despite its effective portrayal of Ellis Act evictions through the years, the mapping project leaves some stories out. An important factor that is missing from this map is neighborhood demographics. As is apparent in America’s long history of discriminatory housing practices like redlining, ethnic segregation and institutionalized racism permeate every aspect of our society. For this reason, it would have been illuminating to examine and show how the Ellis Act evictions have affected different demographics in different ways. It is crucial to reveal the relationship between the identity of the evicted tenants to understand how housing practices are targeted and discriminate against historically disadvantaged minority groups such as the LGBTQ+ community, the elderly, and people of color. 

Another important story left unexplored by this mapping project is the impact of the Ellis Act on the availability of affordable housing. Though helpful in revealing trends of eviction, the map would benefit by revealing how the Ellis Act evictions have affected the ongoing housing crisis in San Francisco. This leads to the thread I wish to follow: the emergence and prevalence of affordable housing projects in the city. 

## Affordable Housing

Using data on affordable housing projects in San Francisco from the [Mayor's Office of Housing and Community Development](https://data.sfgov.org/Housing-and-Buildings/Map-of-MOHCD-s-Affordable-Rental-Portfolio/2hwb-ndvk
), I wish to map the construction and scale of affordable housing projects throughout the years. In essence, I wish to create an “anti-map” to the AEMP’s Ellis Act Eviction map that tells the other side of the story and is represented in the same fashion. To do this, I will utilize the same visual language by representing each affordable housing project as a point on the map appearing in the year of its construction. Like the Ellis Act eviction map, I will scale each point on the map in proportion to the quantity of affordable units provided by the project to achieve the same ease of understanding in the map. In this way, I hope to illuminate trends of housing and visualize where affordable housing is available within the city. By revealing where housing is concentrated, I hope to shed light on both our successes and failures in bringing affordable housing to different parts of the city. I mainly focus on constructing a narrative about the needs of low-income renters in San Francisco and the integration of affordable housing in the context of SF’s worsening housing crisis. 

However, this proposed mapping project has its downfalls as well. Due to its similar structure to the AEMP’s Ellis Act eviction map, it will also leave out illuminating data on the demographics of those served by the affordable housing projects. Along the same lines, the map may not accurately indicate how such housing projects are being used and whether they have fulfilled their goals of providing housing to low-income renters.

Though these variables serve as limitations in my proposed mapping project, I hope the map will succeed in visualizing affordable housing throughout the years just as AEMP’s Ellis Act eviction map succeeded in visualizing Ellis evictions throughout time in San Francisco.
